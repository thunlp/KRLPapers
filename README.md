	> This paper proposes a novel knowledge graph embedding model—namely, Hierarchy-Aware Knowledge Graph Embedding (HAKE). HAKE maps entities into the polar coordinate system to model semantic hierarchies, which are common in
real-world applications. HAKE is inspired by the fact that concentric circles in the polar coordinate system can naturally reflect the hierarchy.

	> This paper tackles a realistic problem setting of few-shot out-of-graph link prediction, aiming to perform link prediction not only between seen and unseen entities but also among unseen entities. To tackle this problem, they propose a novel meta-learning framework, Graph Extrapolation Network (GEN), which meta-learns the node embeddings for unseen entities, to obtain low error on link prediction for both seen-to-unseen and unseen-to-unseen cases.
